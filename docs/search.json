    "text": "DeepAcoustics is an open-access, MATLAB-based tool that was modified from a program called DeepSqueak (Coffey et al., 2019). Originally designed for use with ultrasonic calls from rats for neurological studies, our modification of the program has led to an independent version of the software that is optimized to detect calls in noisier, underwater environments. Additional modifications to the classification capabilities are incorporated in DeepAcoustics.\nDeepAcoustics Overview:",

    "text": "Recent developments in deep learning approaches to detection and classification of signals from some species have proven successful at accurately detecting calls using trained models in varying noise conditions. Deep learning methods of detection and classification are increasing in utility within the underwater acoustic community (Allen et al., 2021; Shui et al., 2020; Vickers et al., 2021). Deep neural networks use automated means of spectrogram image classification that perform well when using an appropriately trained model. By means of rapid automated detection independent of operator experience, deep learning methods have the potential to minimize the drudgery of processing passive acoustic data, leading to more timely use of this information in research studies or biodiversity monitoring projects.\nA variety of signal processing, pattern recognition and machine learning techniques have improved detection and classification of marine mammal sounds through automation, but vary with respect to performance level (Usman, et al., 2020). Deep learning models are a form of machine learning that applies different filter banks at different scales and determines features used to discriminate signals during a learning stage (Bianco, et al., 2019). The models are thus not reliant on meeting criteria for a series of target values, but rather independently determine important features using one of several neural networks. Several studies report high percentages of precision and recall, and improved performance when testing involved multiple datasets collected in variable acoustic conditions (Kirsebom, et al., 2020; Shiu et al., 2020). In addition to improved detection, deep neural networks offer capabilities in classifying marine mammal vocalizations, allowing for their use with multi-species analyses (Thomas et al., 2019).\nAllen, A.
